# Stepmania X Speed-checkout Extension

Chrome extension that helps speedrun Stepmaniax checkout process. These things get sold out so fast when they're dropped, that by the time you've manually refreshed, seen that it's available, add to cart, and checkout: it's already gone!

## How to use

- Go to Stepmaniax store and try to purchase something to get to checkout screen first. Setup express checkout.
- Checkout their Twitter page for time of next drop.
- A few minutes before drop, go to https://shop.steprevolution.com/collections/frontpage/products/stepmaniax-stage-5th-generation. In the extension menu (click on the icon), press the button. It will reload until the "Sold Out" changes, then automatically add it to cart and proceed to checkout.
- After it's on the checkout page, use express checkout. Entire process should be done in a fraction of the time it would take to do manually.
